## Why AppLocker, why now?

It’s a malware world out there. New malware strains pop up throughout the world today like weeds on a warm spring day. 
According to Infosecurity Group, researchers detected over 360,000 new malicious files in 2017. That equates to about four new malware samples every second. Albeit a considerable quantity, the number of new malicious exploits isn’t surprising. The bad guys use automation to generate and distribute malware variants. As a result, the anti-malware community struggles to keep up.

## How to save yourself from this trouble?

Use SecureBox. Secure Box is a concept app that uses Jetpack Security to encrypt user data such as text files or images using Encrypted Shared Preferences and uses Biometrics for authentication. The data can only be decrypted after the user is authorized via a master key or Biometric authentication. The app also displays the list of encrypted files and decrypts them on successful authentication. So you can protect your data and share that such that people only with successful authentication can access it.
